Among thieves is a game for 3 to 5 thieves. Before you start the game, the following should be done:
1. Each thief receives a complete set of 5 action cards: One each of [[Steal]], [[Trap]], [[Sabotage]], [[Heist]], and [[No Honor]].
2. All the coins are put in the the middle of the table. This is [[The City]] and it represents the wealth of the citizens. Then, each thief steals a coin.
4. The [[Heist Locations]] are shuffled and a number of them, equal to the number of thieves minus 2, are placed face down next to **The City** in the middle of the table. The remaining **Heist Locations** are set aside until step 4.b. of the [[Round]].
5. The title of [[Master Thief]] thief goes to whomever snatches the card first!
