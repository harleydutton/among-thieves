{{image embed}}: Steal a coin from another player. If he has 5 or more, steal 2 coins. It's the first card to be revealed and the last to come into effect. If played, this card must be discarded.
IMPORTANT! you can only rob another thief (hence the name of the action). This means the player you want to steal from should have played at least one of the following cards: [[Steal]], [[Heist]], No Honor. If he has exactly Trap and Sabotage, he's not a thief, but is referred to as an "honest businessman." If you try to steal from an honest businessman, you are caught by the constabulary and have to pay that player one coin, it able. The coin is added to his fortune!
