zones: I haven't talked much about the various discard piles players have or the three main zones they all have (in play, in hand, discard)


``` exists
honest businessmen: this might come up in the no honor card. Not sure if it should be in the abstract concepts section
```

```exists
Interrupt: this has been more tightly linked with the trap and sabotage cards though I could imagine a world where this was abstracted out.
```

``` Included!
Heist locations and the heist location deck: currently thinking I need to make this section and add it to the abstract concepts section

thief: basically just the intro. I think this would clutter the document with links though it might be good to set this as the norm and compliment to honest businessmen

Coins: These aren't abstract... Like, they have phys-reps. I think I can get away with never talking about these.
