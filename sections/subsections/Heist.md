[[Heist Card.png|Heist Card]]: Plan out a big, but risky, score. If nothing goes wrong you could get up to three coins later in the round!
1. On your turn, reveal your **Heist**.
2. If not [[Sabotage|Sabotaged]], place your **Heist** on a [[Heist Locations|Heist Location]] that doesn't have another thief's **Heist** on it. If all the **Heist Locations** already have **Heists** on them you can replace the **Heist** of a wealthier thief. If you do, they do not resolve their **Heist**.
3. Resolution: In step 4 of the [[Round]], flip the **Heist Location** you placed your **Heist** on face up. If it has coins on the face get that many coins from [[The City]]. If it is the [[Jail Card.png|Jail Card]] or if you were **Sabotaged**, you instead get [[Caught]].
