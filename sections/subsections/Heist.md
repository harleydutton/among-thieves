[[Heist Card.png]]: This "high risk, high reward" action allows you to try your luck for one of the big bounties. If not interrupted by [[Sabotage]], you put your **Heist Card** on one of the unoccupied heist locations. If all are occupied by other players you can choose one already taken and put your card on it. If you have less money than the player who put his heist card before you, you replace him. Otherwise (if he has less than to equal to your coins), you cannot heist.

IMPORTANT! when you put your card on top of a heist location, you do not reveal what's on it. This happens in "The Reward" step of the game (See playing the game).\
