[[Sabotage Card.png|Sabotage Card]]: Throw a wrench in another thief's plans. Can be played in two different ways:
- As an interrupt: When a thief plays [[Heist]], proceeding clockwise from the thief playing it, each other thief will have a chance to play **Sabotage** and get the thief attempting to **Heist** [[Caught]]. This does not count as revealing a card for [[problems|your turn]].
- On your turn: You may play **Sabotage** on your turn by pointing to a thief who hasn't revealed a **Heist** card yet. If that thief plays **Heist** this [[Round]] they are immediately **Caught**.
