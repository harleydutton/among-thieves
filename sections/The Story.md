A band of thieves once gathered at a table in a small tavern. They drank and sang and drank again, until one of them started boasting about their incredible skills.
"You, thieves, couldn't take a penny from a beggar," they said.
"Ha!" snorted another one, apparently offended. "Says who? [[problems for later|Mx.]] I-rob-old-ladies? None of you are my equal!"
A third thief laughed so hard, they almost fell off their chair. The thieves got into a heated argument, shouting at each other and inventing the grossest of insults. Just when a fight seemed inevitable, the youngest of them managed to attract everyone's attention.
"Calm down, [[problems for later|comrades]], no need for blood. Say, we're all betting folk, are we not? How about a wager to settle this once and for all, eh?"
And so it began.
