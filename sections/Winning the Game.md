The game ends when a thief has amassed a fortune of 7 or more coins immediately after step [[problems|5]] of a [[Round]]. If multiple thieves have 7 or more coins, the thief with the most coins wins. If there is a tie for the largest fortune, the game continues as usual until a clear winner emerges.
