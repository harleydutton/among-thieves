The [[Trap]] and [[Sabotage]] cards can be played as **Interrupts**. What this means, is that when a thief plays [[Steal]] or [[Heist]], proceeding clockwise from the thief playing it, each other thief will have a chance to play [[Trap]] or [[Sabotage]] respectively. This does not count as revealing a card for your turn.
