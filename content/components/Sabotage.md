|![[sabotage.png\|100]]|Throw a wrench in another thief's plans. Can be played in two different ways:<ul><li>Preemptively: You may play **Sabotage** on your turn by pointing to a thief who hasn't revealed a [[Heist]] card yet. If that thief plays **Heist** this [[Round]] they get [[Caught]].</li><li>As an interrupt: When a thief plays **Heist**, proceeding clockwise from the thief playing it, each other thief will have a chance to play **Sabotage** and get the thief attempting to **Heist** **Caught**. This does not count as playing a card on your turn.</li></ul>|
