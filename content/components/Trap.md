|![[trap.png\|100]]|Foil a petty theft. Can be played in two different ways:<ul><li>Preemptively: You may play **Trap** on your turn by pointing at a thief who hasn't revealed a [[Steal]] card yet. If that thief plays **Steal** this [[Round]] they get [[Caught]].</li><li>As an interrupt: When a thief plays **Steal**, proceeding clockwise from the thief playing it, each other thief will have a chance to play **Trap** and get the thief attempting to **Steal** **Caught**. This does not count as playing a card on your turn.</li></ul>|
