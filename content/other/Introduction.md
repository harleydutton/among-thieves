In Among Thieves, you take the role of a thief, trying to prove you're the best in the trade by accumulating the greatest fortune. You will do this by carefully planning street robberies and dangerous heists, but also by setting traps for the others and sabotaging their well-prepared burglaries. And don't forget--players are just as good as any other mark, for there is no honor among thieves!
