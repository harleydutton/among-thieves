A band of thieves once gathered at a table in a small tavern. They drank and sang and drank again, until one of them started boasting about his incredible skills.
"You thieves couldn't take a penny from a beggar," he said.
"Ha!" snorted another one, apparently offended. "Says who? Mr. I-rob-old-ladies? None of you are *my* equal!"
A third thief laughed so hard, she almost fell out of her chair. They got into a heated argument, shouting at each other and inventing the grossest of insults. Just when a fight seemed inevitable, the youngest of them managed to attract everyone's attention.
"Calm down, friends, there is no need for blood. Say, we're all betting folk, are we not? How about a wager to settle this once and for all, eh?"
And so it began.
