- If you don't follow the rules for any reason and are hindered by it, that's just too bad.
- If you don't follow the rules and benefit from it, you're not just a thief--you're a liar and a cheat! If the other thieves catch you they frame you and the [[The City]] takes all your coins!
- If you would have to pay a coin but don't have any, you get a beating from the constabulary and are just as poor as you were.
- You cannot take blood from a stone--if you would steal from a thief or **The City** when they have no coins, you get nothing!
