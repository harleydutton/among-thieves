- Don't shuffle revealed [[Heist Locations]] into the Heist Location deck until the deck is empty.
- Each [[Round]], resolve [[No Honor]] cards in turn order, starting with the [[Master Thief]] as soon as they are revealed in step 2.a. and skip step 3.b.
- Allow [[Sabotage]] to be played a third way: On thieves who have already revealed a [[Heist]].
- When [[Heist|Heists]] resolve in step 3.a. of the [[Round]] the heisting thief takes the [[Heist Locations|Heist Location]]. They can look at it but they they are not able to find a fence or get [[Caught]] until step 3.a. of the *next* round. They will not gain or lose any coins from the **Heist** until then.
